## Overview

In this project, I created a personal professional profile website deployed on GitHub Pages. The site includes my resume, education, experience, skills, and interactive JavaScript components such as clocks and live APIs. I also integrated two public APIs and added localStorage-based tracking for first-time and returning visitors.

Through this assignment, I strengthened my understanding of front-end development, AJAX-based web services, JavaScript state handling, and GitHub-based deployment.

## Final Thoughts

This project helped me integrate multiple frontend concepts including dynamic JavaScript behavior, public web APIs, and persistent browser state. It was also a valuable experience in deploying a site publicly using GitHub Pages, making it suitable for real-world professional use.
